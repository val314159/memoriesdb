# MemoriesDB - a Database for Memories

## Access your LLM chat history and forms new memories in the same data store

- the NULL session

document timechain
- locality - deal with data where it is
- use a stored procedure?
- filtering, dynmaically
- when we get to start of prev partial session, jump to next
- moves backwards, seems like a natural way for memories to work

where is the most effiecient point?
  - intermediary
    - right at the point of copying
  - actually one better
    - pre-indexed (bucketed)

# truth, streaking, and rainbow parties
  - MAYBE a parinbow party happened one time, but probably not
  - why was one a thing and not the other
  - sustainability
  - streaking was never going to last - fad
