# MemoriesDB Project Plan

A phase-based project plan for developing the MemoriesDB system.

## Phase 0: Finalize SQL files

- [X] Write SQL files
- [X] Sign off on SQL files as complete

## Phase 1: Esdtablish Dev Flow

- [X] Simple Makefile
  - [X] write Dockerfile for memoriesdb vm
  - [X] make pgvector-start (use docker /pgvector image)
  - [X] make pgvector-stop  (use docker /pgvector image )
  - [X] make memories-start (use docker use Dockerfile)
  - [X] make memories-stop  (use docker use Dockerfile)
  - [ ] make setup-db and reset-db

## Phase 2: Core Backend API

- [X] db_utils.py - direct SQL call and super-low level stuff.  Everything else in the system should go thru this layer to get to the DB!!!! (if there's a problem tell the user immediately)
- [X] core_api.py - wraps low level to make medium level logical calls.
